/*
 * Pioneer CDJ-2000 audio DSP — the model.
 *
 * This is everything the virtual DSP *is*.  cdj2000_dsp.c owns the window, the
 * DMA and the registers and knows nothing about meaning; this file knows only
 * meaning and never touches a register.  The point of the split is that a real
 * engine can take this file's place, in-process or through the chardev, without
 * the device changing.
 *
 * What it deliberately is not: there is no audio path here at all.  No PCM, no
 * decoder, no filters, no output.  MAIN needs a DSP that answers and keeps a
 * position running; that is what this provides.
 *
 * The command vocabulary is being filled in from evidence rather than guessed.
 * What is settled so far:
 *
 *   - the request word is 0xac0cffec, the answer word 0xac0cfffc, and 0xac0cfff0
 *     carries an argument (every firmware record header repeats it as W[+0x0e]);
 *   - MAIN downloads two firmware records into the window, the second to offset
 *     0x7800 — which is where the addresses it reads all over the image
 *     (0xac0c7ba0, 0xac0c7ccc, 0xac0c8140, 0xac0c81a0 …) live, so that region is
 *     the shared control block rather than code;
 *   - DspTASK (0x1c80aa) dispatches on a byte through a 13-entry table at
 *     0x1c8054, and tsk_DJcontTxDspPCM/DEC each own a _cmd and a _ret buffer.
 *
 * Until each field is measured on a running machine it is left alone: writing
 * plausible values into a block the firmware then checksums is a good way to
 * turn a missing device into a wrong one, which is harder to diagnose.

 * load never rings the mailbox doorbell at all.  It writes 1 into the control
 * block at window+0x7ba0 and MAIN's DSP state machine (0x19feb0) then polls
 * that word and its neighbours with `cmp/pl`: a positive value is a request
 * still pending, zero is done, negative is an error, and the word at +4 is

 * into the same word (0x1a0a86..0x1a0a90) and polls window+0x7b80 the same way.
 * Nothing answered, so the load stayed pending for ever behind MAIN's
 * NOW LOADING blink.
 *
 * With this on, every 10 ms tick turns a request word (the table below) into
 * 0 and, for the command words, writes 0 into the result word at +4, which is
 * the "done, no error" reading of the poller (the firmware record leaves a large positive
 * constant there, which the poller reads as "still pending" -- trackload-23
 * completed the load's first command that way and MAIN then stopped the
 * player with E-8302 qualifier 0x200f).  A command is a small positive code: 1, 5 and 6 are
 * the ones MAIN's machine writes (0x1a0a86..0x1a0a90).  The firmware record
 * MAIN downloads fills the same words with large constants (0x01c1e02b,
 * 0x2fc37011 -- trackload-22 cleared those at t=1.3 s before the rule was
 * narrowed), so anything at or above DSP_ACK_COMMAND_LIMIT is left alone.
 * Each acknowledgement is reported on stderr, so a run says which commands
 * MAIN issued and in what order -- that is the vocabulary the rest of this

 *   16 n = 0 (0x8002f45c..0x8002f4a4).  Command 2 writes slot 5 + n's record,
 *   the OUT (0x8002f44c).  Recording slot 5 + n where the deck is (0x12)
 *   builds loop n's entry from slot n's point (0x8002d044).
 * - The END the play pass turns back at is the cached one while its flag is
 *   set, slot 5 + n's point otherwise (0x8002baec -> 0x8002bc2c); its start
 *   is slot n's point (0x8002bac8).  A loop is defined when either exists
 *   (0x8002eecc).
 * - Which loop plays is MAIN's word +0x7bc8, read every command pass
 *   (0x80043c68): n + 1 makes slot n the active loop slot 0x100255e4 if loop
 *   n is defined, anything else -1 (0x80043ca4..0x80043cd8).  The play pass
 *   loops only on the active slot (0x80017960..0x800179e8).  So EXIT and
 *   RELOOP are MAIN taking that word away and giving it back; the jump MAIN
 *   sends with RELOOP (0x21 slot 0) only moves the deck to the IN.

/*
 * The stream header at +0x8140 and the two fill levels.
 *
 * MAIN keeps two buffers in the DSP and reads their fill levels at +0x7ccc
 * (buffer 2) and +0x7cd0 (buffer 1).  Byte 3 of the header is its class, and
 * where the buffer sits depends on the class.  The DSP program's own header
 * dispatcher (4.33, main-unpacked.bin 0xe3d0.. loaded at DSP 0x80000000; the
 * window is DSP 0x10030000, so +0x8140 is 0x10038140) takes exactly these
 * words, 0x80040e28..0x80040f5c:
 *
 *   class 1  0x01010100 0x01020100 0x01010200 0x01010101 0x01020101
 *            0x01010102 0x01020102       -> 0x80041208
 *   class 2  0x02000100 0x02000200       -> 0x80042570, the drop
 *   class 3  0x03000100 0x03000200       -> 0x80042734
 *   class 4  0x04010000 0x04020000       -> 0x80041e68
 *
 * A drop names its buffer in byte 1: 0x80042570 passes index 0 for
 * 0x02000100 and 1 for 0x02000200 to the drop proper (0x8002afec), and
 * MAIN's drop routine (0x1be0ec..0x1be1be) sends 0x02000100 with
 * min(+0x7cd0, 40) and 0x02000200 with min(+0x7ccc, 40) in +0x8144 -- byte 1
 * = 1 is buffer 1, 2 is buffer 2, and the level's unit is the count's unit.
 * A negative count is 20 to the DSP (0x800425d4).  The DSP writes both levels
 * in one place, 0x80045010: +0x7ccc and +0x7cd0 from the halfwords +0x10 and
 * +0x12 of the current deck's 22-byte record.
 *
 * Class 1 is the stream's data path.  MAIN 4.33 writes 0x01010100 once as
 * the open after a format command, then 0x01020100 with 40 in +0x8144 for
 * every transfer (cosim scenario-8, an MP3: one open per record, 2246 data
 * headers in the first minute); 0x01010200 is a third writer's (0x1a2a9e,
 * 0x1a6626).  The DSP handler tests bit 17 (byte 2 = 2), bit 9 (byte 1 = 2)
 * and the low nibble separately, takes the record id on the open (see
 * cdj_dsp_model_stream_open) and consumes the doorbell buffers that follow
 * (0x80041310, 0x80045fe4).  The model reads byte 2 of a class-1 header as the
 * buffer those transfers fill.  That is what makes the load's pre-fill below
 * come out, not yet something traced to the level halfwords in the DSP code.
 *
 * The load's pre-fill (0x1b6ffe..0x1b7048) sends buffers until +0x7ccc >= 160
 * and +0x7cd0 >= 40 (the other branch, 0x1b6faa.., wants 80 and 160), and only
 * then reports the load done.  trackload-34: with nothing keeping the levels,
 * MAIN streamed the whole file at the acknowledgement rate and NOW LOADING
 * never ended.  A DSP that has taken a transfer adds its count to the level;
 * this does that.  Nothing is played, so nothing is subtracted yet.
 */

/*
 * How much a buffer holds: the whole track.  trackload-36 and -41: with every
 * transfer taken at once MAIN pushed the whole file (3704 transfers of 9408
 * bytes plus 1620 of 8192, 33 MB) and reported the load done at the last one
 * -- and that is the machine: the CDJ-2000 loads a track into the DSP's own
 * 32 MB SDRAM (IC505, K4S561632J, service manual p. 48), which is why the
 * card can be pulled while it plays.  trackload-37 tried a six-transfer
 * capacity instead: the seventh header stayed pending, MAIN waited on it
 * without a timeout (0x1a3a10: 2 ms polls, no limit) and the load never
 * finished.  So a data header is always taken; the levels only tell MAIN how
 * much is buffered.
 *
 * The format word: 2 is the load's PCM format; 3 (parameters 0, 2, 0x480,
 * 0x30) opens the second phase of the same load, in which MAIN sends
 * 8192-byte buffers through the doorbell path (+0x81c4, +0x81c8 alternating,
 * trackload-41 t=298.7 -- before any PLAY press, so not playback, as
 * trackload-36's coincidence with one had suggested).  Nothing is consumed:
 * playback is not modelled, the levels only grow.
 *
 * +0x81c8 is not a level: the DSP's buffer taker 0x80045fe4 reads it as the
 * half of the staging area the data sits in, 0x100381e0 + index * 0x3cc0 --
 * +0x81e0 or +0xbea0, the two buffers the PCM sender fills.  With format 3 or
 * 4 in force the doorbell buffers go to 0x80047280 or 0x80046728 (picked by
 * 0x800463c8 on the kind), which hand them to a stream object; neither calls
 * the level report 0x80045010 directly.  So booking every transfer to the
 * last class-1 buffer, as cdj_dsp_model_firmware does, is right for a class-1
 * stream and unverified for a format-3 one.
 */

/*
 * CDJ_DSP_SLOT_REPORT -- an experiment on the slot table below and the event
 * line.  trackload-50/51b measured that a bare event (any code 1..13, no
 * parameters, the table empty) makes MAIN's player task issue the player
 * commands 1 and 2 within 100 ms and, five times in run 50, report an error
 * stop ("ｴﾗｰ停止通知をﾌﾟﾚｰﾔｰﾀｽｸから受理した", GUI: E-8302 CANNOT PLAY TRACK
 * (C611)); the DspTASK's record poster 0x1c7c62 was never called, so the
 * event is handled by the player task itself, which is also what copies the
 * slot entry (0x1b39cc: +96.. and state +128 into its deck record).  So the
 * event presumably says "read the table".  With CDJ_DSP_SLOT_REPORT=<state>
 * the model, once MAIN has closed the load (command 4 then 2 in +0x7ba0),
 * writes that state and position 0 into the first four entries and raises
 * one event; PLAY (3) makes it state 3 and another event.  What MAIN then
 * shows -- time fields, or E-8302 again -- is the measurement.
 * trackload-52-slotreport, state 2: MAIN answered the event with the player
 * commands 1, 2, 1 and reported an error stop ("ｴﾗｰ停止通知", E-8302) --
 * the same as a bare event during a load, and unlike a bare event after
 * one (trackload-51b: commands 1 and 2, no error).  trackload-53, state 1:
 * the same error stop.  So the entry is read, a non-zero state with position
 * 0 is not what a loaded deck looks like, and the next step is the reader
 * (0x1b39cc..0x1b3a60 and what it does with its deck record), not a fourth
 * guess.
