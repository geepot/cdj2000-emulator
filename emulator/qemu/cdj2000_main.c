/*
 * Pioneer CDJ-2000 MAIN board (SuperH SH-4)
 *
 * Board model for reverse engineering the MAIN firmware of a CDJ-2000, so that
 * the real firmware — rather than a hand-written peer — can answer the Blackfin
 * GUI board that is emulated separately in the GNU simulator.
 *
 * The memory map is derived from the firmware image itself, not from a
 * datasheet (none is public):
 *
 *   - the reset vector loads r15 = 0xa8000000, so the top of SDRAM is at
 *     physical 0x08000000;
 *   - the boot DMA copies the packed payload to 0xa7a00000 and a stub to
 *     0xa7de0000, i.e. physical 0x07a00000 and 0x07de0000;
 *   - the unpacked application links at 0xa4000000, i.e. physical 0x04000000;
 *   - every known RAM object lies between those two.
 *
 * One contiguous 64 MiB SDRAM at physical 0x04000000 satisfies all of it.
 *
 * The SoC is not an SH7750/SH7751: it puts the DMAC at 0xff608000 and has
 * peripherals at 0xff401000, 0xff501000, 0xffd40000 and 0xfff10000.  Rather
 * than guess a part number, every peripheral access is trapped and logged, so
 * the requirement list is measured.  Devices are then added one at a time.

 * The timer, and how its interrupt reaches the firmware.
 *
 * The RTOS programs TMU channel 0 the standard SH-4 way — TCOR/TCNT 0x34bb,
 * TCR 0x20 (underflow interrupt), TSTR bit 0 — and its interrupt entry at
 * VBR+0x600 dispatches on INTEVT: handler = [0x04fcd904 + (INTEVT >> 3)].
 *
 * The vector is **not** the architectural TUNI0 code 0x400.  This SoC routes
 * the TMU through its INTC2 as irq 0x2c, and INTEVT = irq * 0x20 = 0x580.
 * Read out of the live machine: at 0x400 the table holds the default stub
 * 0x2e67b0, which walks an empty handler list and returns without touching the
 * timer — so delivering 0x400 produces an interrupt nothing ever acknowledges.
 * The entry for 0x580 resolves to the ISR at image 0x260548, whose function
 * 0x2604da is the only registered handler that touches TSTR (0xffd80004) and
 * TCR0 (0xffd80010), i.e. the one that clears the underflow flag.
 *
 * 0x34bb + 1 counts at P-phi/4 per tick; a 1 ms tick (the firmware has a task
 * called Dummy1ms) puts P-phi at 54 MHz.
 */
#define TMU_BASE        0xffd80000
/*
 * A second three-channel timer block, TMU3..TMU5.  The application only
 * counts on it (TCOR3 is read for elapsed time), but the *loader* -- the
 * recovery image the boot ROM unpacks from flash 0x10000 when the packed
 * application's checksum fails -- has no use for TMU0 at all: its RTOS tick
 * is TMU4 (0x401dfac: TCOR4 0x34bc, TCR4 0x20, TSTR2 bit 1, the same 1 ms as
 * the application's TMU0) and TMU5 is a 10 ms companion (TCOR5 0x20f58).
 * The loader writes their levels into INT2PRI1[20:16] and [12:8] (both 4) and
 * clears INT2MSKR bit 1, the TMU3-5 group; their INTEVT codes are 0xe00,
 * 0xe20 and 0xe40 (SH7764 manual table 13.3).  Without those lines routed
 * the loader boots to its "Cente USBH-MSC sample program" banner, sees the
 * stick, and never issues the bus reset its attach handler schedules through
 * a delay (update-21): every dly_tsk waits on a tick that never comes.

/*
 * The SoC's own interrupt controller is an SH7780-style INTC2 at 0xffd40000,
 * not an SH7750 INTC: the image writes USERIMASK at 0xffd30000 with the 0xA5
 * key (0x2603b6) and INT2PRI0-7 at 0xffd40000-1c, and contains no reference at
 * all to the SH7750 IPRA/IPRB/IPRC.
 *
 * The three INT2PRI registers the firmware actually programs are modelled
 * below, so the guest sets its own interrupt levels and the board cannot drift
 * out of step with the image.  It also gets the enable gating for free: the
 * boot zeroes INT2PRI0..7 at 0x2603b8 and only writes a level when it wants a
 * source live, and sh_intc treats a zero field as "not enabled", so a source
 * is offered only once the firmware has asked for it.
 *
 * The levels that come out of this, and where the firmware writes them:
 *
 *   TMU0, the tick   INT2PRI0[31:24]  8   0x2604f2-0x26050c
 *   SCIF receive     INT2PRI2[31:24]  4   0x10237c-0x102386
 *   GUI link arm     INT2PRI4[15:8]   4   0x2a39aa-0x2a39b4
 *   GUI link mode    INT2PRI4[7:0]    4   0x2a3a70-0x2a3a7e
 *   second channel   INT2PRI5[7:0]    4   0x2a3a48-0x2a3a50, 0x2a3b0c-0x2a3b1a
 *   TMU4/5, loader   INT2PRI1[20:16], [12:8]  4   0x401dfe6-0x401dffc (loader only)
 *
 * That ordering is what real hardware does and it matters: the tick outranks a
 * link ISR and preempts it.  With the levels the other way round a link ISR
 * runs its whole body at an IMASK that blocks the tick throughout, which
 * starves the RTOS clock under GUI load.
 *
 * Do not take the levels from the +16 word of the 20-byte registration
 * records: it says 4 for the tick and 15 for the links, disagrees with these
 * hardware writes, and the registrar 0x2ecd74 never reads it.
 *
 * The RTOS's own SR levels corroborate the range: tasks run at IMASK 0 (the
 * dispatcher force-clears it with & 0xffffff0f at 0x2e6f9a), the interrupt
 * prologue at 0x2e6426 installs IMASK 10 before it acknowledges anything so
 * that the tick cannot re-enter, and loc_cpu (0x2e6734) installs IMASK 15.
 * Devices belong in 1..8 and both kernel windows sit above them.  Measured
 * with the level hardcoded: 11, 14 and 15 reset the guest in about two
 * seconds, 10 and 8 survive.
 *
 * INT2MSKR/INT2MSKCR at 0xffd40038/3c are deliberately left on the catch-all
 * trap.  Their polarity is inverted relative to QEMU's intc_mask_reg — a set
 * bit means masked, and the boot writes 0xffffffff — so modelling them as
 * INTC_MODE_DUAL_SET would mask every source off.  Priority does the gating.

 * The PANEL board.
 *
 * The panel is an M16C part on a second SCIF at 0xffe20000, and MAIN does not
 * touch that UART's data registers itself — two DMAC channels do.  `M16C_Task`
 * (0x2473f8) calls the arm function 0x246e36, which programs both halves of one
 * full-duplex exchange and then starts them (0x246f1e..0x246f76):
 *
 *   0xff608030 (ch3)  SAR = 0xffe20014 (SCFRDR), DAR = buffer, TCR = length
 *   0xff608040 (ch4)  SAR = buffer, DAR = 0xffe2000c (SCFTDR), TCR = length
 *   0xff608060        DMAOR |= 1, then CHCR |= 4 (IE) and |= 1 (DE) on each
 *   0xffd4003c        |= 0x100, unmasking the channel in INTC2
 *
 * so the channel roles are self-describing: whichever half points at SCFRDR is
 * the receive.  The completions arrive as the DMAC's own vectors — read out of
 * the RTOS table at 0x04fcd904, the six live DMAC entries are INTEVT 0x640,
 * 0x660, 0x680, 0x6a0, 0x780 and 0x7a0, i.e. channels 0..5 in order, which puts
 * ch3 on 0x6a0 and ch4 on 0x780.
 *
 * `FUN_a428fdbc` passes length 0x18, and the frame format is fixed by the
 * validator 0x28cdf8, which is short enough to read exactly: 24 bytes, of which
 * 0..21 are payload copied on to 0x04fe29fc, byte 22 is the sum of those with
 * an end-around carry into the low byte, and byte 23 must be 0x8f.  A frame
 * that passes makes `PnlCom_RcvTASK` call 0x28ceb8, which is the only writer of
 * the panel state at 0x04fe29f4 — the word `PnlCom_SndTASK` needs non-zero
 * before it will publish MAIN's operating mode from inside its handshake
 * instead of from its ten-second fallback.
 *
 * The vectors are not a guess: the M16C task's resource table at 0x0009dfbc
 * registers handler 0x04246f88 on vectors 0x33 and 0x34 at level 4, so DMAC
 * channel n takes vector 48 + n and the two halves land on INTEVT 0x660 and
 * 0x680.  That handler is shared, and it decides which channel it is looking at
 * from a second INTC2 status word at 0xffd4004c — bit 1 for the receive channel
 * and bit 2 for the transmit (0x246f96, 0x246fa2).  Unmodelled it reads zero,
 * so the handler returns without acknowledging anything and the level stays
 * asserted; the status word is therefore as much a part of the device as the
 * channels are.  It is computed rather than stored: a completion that the guest
 * has not yet cleared out of CHCR is exactly what "pending" means.

 * CDJ_BUS_TRACE — find a peripheral we have not modelled by letting the

 *
 * cdj_periph_init above traps the SH-4 on-chip block at 0xff000000, so anything
 * unmodelled *there* is already logged.  The external bus is the blind spot:
 * the USB function controller sits at physical 0x01000000, an ordinary chip on
 * a chip-select, and r196 showed that every access in the boot trace belongs to
 * that function controller — the type-B socket facing a computer.  A memory
 * stick goes into the type-A socket and needs a USB *host* controller, which is
 * a different chip at a different address, and an access to it would land in
 * unmapped area-0 space where reads answer 0 and writes vanish **silently**.
 * That silence is indistinguishable from "the driver never ran", which is
 * exactly the question.
 *
 * So this maps the whole of area 0 at a priority below every real device — the
 * flash, the RAM, the USB window and the rest all overlay it untouched — and
 * logs what falls through.  Behaviour is unchanged: reads still answer 0 and
 * writes are still dropped, they are merely no longer invisible.  Addresses are
 * deduplicated so a polling loop reports once rather than filling the log.
 *
 * Off unless CDJ_BUS_TRACE is set, so the default machine is bit-for-bit what
 * it was.
 *
 * Deduplication is per 4 KiB PAGE, not per address.  The first run of this
 * trace was swallowed by a linear 4-byte read sweep from 0x08000000 that filled
 * a 512-address budget by itself and masked everything that came after it — the
 * budget has to survive a memory scan to be able to show a register window.
 * The first access in each page is logged with its exact address, and a page is
 * reported once.

 *
 * Every frame carries an 8-byte "CDJL" + little-endian length header, because
 * the wire here is a TCP socket and the thing it stands in for is not.  MAIN
 * mixes 64-byte status records with payload records of 48 to 896 bytes (see
 * LINK_FRAME_MAX); a peer reading a flat byte stream cannot tell where one
 * ends, and a single 224-byte frame read
 * as three-and-a-half 64-byte ones leaves it 32 bytes out of phase for the rest
 * of the run -- every record fails its checksum from then on and the GUI puts
 * E-8709 on screen.  The header is skipped by a peer that does not know it (the
 * simulator falls back to raw bytes when the magic is absent), so it costs
 * nothing but makes the boundary explicit.

 * CDJ_LINK_TX_US: how long a transmitted frame is in flight before its

 *
 * Why it exists, and why it is off.  With the completion synchronous, MAIN
 * answers the GUI's browse requests in one burst every 3.000 s -- hundreds
 * of 48-byte answers 0.1 ms apart behind one 64-byte status record, then
 * nothing for three seconds -- while the GUI asks sixty times a second
 * (usb3, 130 s).  That looks like a completion landing before the sending
 * task has reached its wait, which a frame's time on the wire (64 bytes at
 * a megabit or so: a few hundred microseconds) would cure.  Measured at
 * 500 us, same binaries otherwise: one boot without a key answered spread
 * out instead of in bursts and reached the player screen at 34 s as before
 * (m1); two boots with a SOURCE key at 40 s never showed the player screen
 * at all -- one stayed black for 130 s (usb8), one sent only status
 * requests and drew nothing (usb7) -- where the same configuration without
 * it shows the player screen at 28 s and the Wait platter six seconds after
 * the key (usb6).  The two boards' protocol tasks are balanced against each
 * other by timing on both sides (dv-bfin_ppi.c's yield budget and holds),
 * and moving this one edge upsets that balance.  Kept for the experiment
 * that finds the matching change on the other side.

 * CDJ_REQ_KIND=<n> -- make the browse request name the medium that is mounted.
 *
 * Word 4 of a type-1 request is the KIND MAIN answers for (LINK/USB/SD/DISC =
 * 0/1/2/3).  `r156` measured **506 of 506** cursor-1 type-1 requests carrying
 * 1 (USB) on a machine whose only medium is the SD card and whose own status
 * says so (`0x04c084d4 = 1`).  MAIN then answers exactly the question it was
 * asked: `0x150490` hands that word to `0x14e4d4` as both the row index and
 * the selector, `sel 1` stamps slot 3, and slot 3 is not the card -- slot 2
 * is, and it is the only row whose category flag the mount notifier
 * (`0x142c3e`) ever set.
 *
 * So this rewrites the one word, on the way in, and re-stamps the checksum --
 * without that the request is dropped and the switch would silently measure
 * nothing.  It is off unless the variable is set, so the same build gives the
 * A and the B side.
 *
 * **Cursor 1 only, and that is a measured boundary, not caution.**  `r158`
 * rewrote every type-1 request and the GUI never left the left column: 1 779
 * cursor-3 requests, no cursor 11 at all, and an empty right pane.  `r157`,
 * which patched only the cursor-1 arm inside MAIN, saw the GUI ask **cursor 11
 * with word 4 = 2 on its own** 2 223 times and fill the pane with the card's
 * folder and playlist.  Cursor 1 is the only arm that writes `[ctx+4]`
 * (`0x150492`); the other cursors read their own word 4 for their own pane, and
 * overwriting it takes the GUI's answer away from it.  `CDJ_REQ_CURSOR`
 * widens this again for anyone who wants to repeat r158.

 * clears its own frame-pending flag 0x7db353c).  "answer" therefore hands the
 * next frame over when MAIN's transmit half sends, whatever it sends, or after
 * the 50 ms watchdog if it never does; the ISR's acknowledge no longer moves
 * the queue -- and neither does the re-arm, because the ISR re-arms the
 * receive itself (0x2a3ff4, before the wake-up): trackload-47-launch, with
 * the acknowledge alone disarmed, handed 713 of 749 queued frames over on
 * that arm, inside the ISR's loop.  So in this mode only MAIN's transmit and
 * the watchdog move the queue.
 *
 * Measured, and that is why it is not the default: MAIN does not answer
 * frames, it sends a status record on its own cycle, about 16 a second
 * whatever the GUI sends (3-launch 17/s, 45 16/s, 47 13/s, 48 16/s).  Paced
 * by those, the FIFO fell behind the GUI (trackload-48-launch2: 45 497
 * frames queued, 39 788 dropped, 4 909 handed over by the 50 ms watchdog),
 * the GUI asked again and again (57 000 frames for 6 301 records), and a
 * record sent while GuiCom_RcvTASK was still reading the buffer replaced the

 * Both halves are modelled, but only as far as the firmware actually uses them.
 *
 * Transmit: the status register always reports the transmitter idle, so the
 * character loop at 0x29f13a — which spins on TDFE with no timeout and no RTOS
 * yield — never waits, and every byte written to the FIFO goes straight out.
 *
 * Receive: this is what carries MAIN's service monitor.  The receive ISR
 * 0x102468 (INTEVT 0x720) proceeds when FSR has RDF or DR set, reads one byte
 * from RDR, appends it to the line buffer at 0x045a1802 echoing as it goes, and
 * on CR shifts the line across and wakes the Rx232c task, which posts it to
 * cmdman.  cmdman matches it against the 38-entry command table at 0xa405c310
 * — WB/WW/WL to write memory, RB/RW/RL to read it, UG for the debug dump.
 *
 * The receive flags are write-to-clear *per bit*, and modelling that exactly is
 * what makes the ISR terminate.  It clears them one at a time
 * (0x102554-0x102562):
 *
 *     FSR &= ~RDF    -> writes 0x61, DR still set
 *     FSR &= ~DR     -> writes 0x62, RDF still set
 *
 * so neither write ever has both bits clear.  A model that regenerates both
 * bits on every read can therefore never be acknowledged: the ISR returns with
 * the source still asserted, and because the level is held it is re-entered
 * immediately — measured at about 14 500 interrupts a second, which starves
 * everything else without ever looking like a crash.  Keep the two bits as
 * state and let each write clear the bits it presents as zero.
 *
 * Transmit needs an interrupt as well, and without it the console goes quiet
 * after its first few characters.  Output is queued by 0x1026be into an RTOS
 * queue and drained by a task, and that task is woken by the transmit
 * interrupt: the ISR 0x10274c (INTEVT 0x760) signals it and then clears TIE
 * with SCSCR2 &= 0xff7f.  So TIE means "tell me when the transmitter has
 * room", and since this transmitter is always idle the line is simply asserted
 * whenever TIE is set — the handler clearing TIE is what lowers it again.
 *
 * QEMU's own sh_serial would do more but insists on a chardev with an id, which
 * rules out a plain "-serial null" slot.

 * Turning the debug output on.
 *
 * Having a working SCIF is only half of it.  Every caller of the string
 * printer 0x29f126 sits behind `if ([0x07db3440] == 0) return`, and that word
 * is read at eight sites (0x29e83e, 0x29ead4, 0x29eb48, 0x29ebd2, 0x29ede6,
 * 0x29ee6e, 0x29f216, 0x29f280) and written by nothing anywhere in the image —
 * on a real unit the service-mode shell pokes it.  With it clear the firmware
 * is silent no matter how well the serial port works.
 *
 * It cannot be set at reset, because it lives in RAM the boot clears, so it is
 * written on a virtual-clock timer once the RTOS is up.  CDJ_DEBUG_CONSOLE
 * gives the delay in seconds of guest time and defaults to five.
 *
 * The flag is only the master switch.  What actually gets printed is chosen by
 * a verbosity threshold at 0x0489bcb4, and the firmware's own way of setting it
 * is a GUI command: the handler at 0x2130a0, inside GuiCom_RcvTASK's
 * dispatcher, prints one of the "GUIcmd: $$$ Dubug Dump ON + Level=..."
 * strings at 0x7271c-0x727a0 and stores
 *
 *      0xff  Debug Dump OFF          (0x2130be)
 *       200  ON + Level=ERR          (0x2130d0)
 *       100  ON + Level=CMD          (0x2130e2)
 *        10  ON, the verbose level   (0x2130f2)
 *
 * so a lower number lets more through.  CDJ_DEBUG_LEVEL picks it and defaults
 * to 10; setting it directly saves having to synthesise the GUI command.
 *
 * This is a debug aid, not hardware: a stock CDJ boots with the console off,
 * so it stays off unless asked for.

 * The SD card slot: a Renesas SDHI (TMIO-compatible) host controller.

 * 0x1ff000-0x200b00 writes to +0x00 — 0x300 is CMD0 GO_IDLE_STATE, 0x408 with
 * argument 0x1aa is CMD8 SEND_IF_COND, 0x437 CMD55, 0x446 ACMD6
 * SET_BUS_WIDTH, 0x410 CMD16, 0x1c4d ACMD13 — and by +0x28 flipping 0xc0ee to

 * offsets are the Linux TMIO MMC ones: status at +0x1c, data at +0x30, clock
 * control at +0x24, DMA enable at +0xd8.
 *
 * Against the catch-all trap, which answers zero, this device costs about a
 * quarter of the guest's CPU and contains one loop that never ends:
 *
 *   0x1ff45c  sd_wait_info1(mask), unrolled twice inside five inside a 65535
 *             iteration outer loop, so ~655 000 MMIO reads, yielding to the
 *             RTOS only every eighth outer pass.  Callers 0x1ff518 (mask 1,
 *             CMDRESPEND, the hot one), 0x1ffd8c and 0x1ffff6 (mask 4).
 *   0x1ff4b8  spins on +0x1e mask 0x0100, RXRDY.
 *   0x1ff846  spins on +0x1e bit 14, CMD_BUSY, with no iteration cap at all.
 *
 * The model is the smallest one that says "the slot is empty" without lying:
 * every wait is satisfied on its first read, and the driver is told the
 * command timed out rather than being left to retry.
 *
 * Returning 0xffff from +0x1c instead would set bit 5, SIGSTATE, which asserts
 * card-present and drives the 30-iteration ACMD41 initialisation loop at
 * 0x1ff678 -- a slower machine and a card that is not there.

 * (1 LINK 0x..68, 2 USB 0x..6c, 3 SD 0x..70, 4 DISC 0x..74).  The GUI's
 * parser (0xb7dfe6) spreads halfword 26 into a table at 0x4b439c in the
 * same order -- bits [11:9] first -- and its key dispatcher (0xb9b98c)
 * routes a SOURCE key on the state at index (halfword 18 - 1), i.e. the
 * source MAIN reports as current.  The screen router (0xb9b706) takes 0
 * to the Wait platter, 1 to the library, and only from the library does
 * the GUI ask MAIN for the card's lists.
 *
 * Measured with the GUI's own table watched (w4, v1): a 1 written to
 * 0x0489bd6c lands in the table at index 1 (USB) and the SD key still
 * routes on index 2 = 0, the platter; a 1 written to 0x0489bd70 lands at
 * index 2 and the same key routes on state 1.  The earlier order
 * "(DISC, SD, USB, LINK)" was a guess that put the card's state on the
 * stick's word.
 * MAIN writes those words through one accessor, 0x14e0be, from its browse
 * answer builder -- and only on the media branch, which needs the database
 * context open ([ctx+0x2d5c]) -- so a card that is mounted is never reported
 * as such until the GUI browses it, and the GUI never browses it while the
 * state says 0.  Measured, SD key on the test card: state 0 at the key ->
 * platter for ever (sd1, sd2, w2); state 1 at the key -> the GUI asks for
 * the card's lists at once and draws PLAYLIST / SEARCH / ARTIST / ALBUM /
 * TRACK / KEY from it (e4, e5).
 *
 * CDJ_SD_MEDIA_STATE=1 makes the board report the card itself: from
 * CDJ_SD_MOUNT_S (5) seconds after the insertion it holds the SD state
 * word at 1, ten times a second.  It is OFF by default, because holding
 * the word is measurably harmful: with it held (e2) MAIN answered the
 * GUI's list request for the card with one-row records for 20 s; without
 * it (e5, f1-f3) MAIN answered the same request with the card's lists at
 * once and the library was on screen 2.6 s after the SD key.  MAIN's own
 * media manager sets the word when the GUI browses the card, and the key
 * gets there without help as long as the GUI's browse loop for the empty
 * boot source has ended (see BFIN_LINK_BUDGET_ANY / BFIN_LINK_DEPTH in the
 * launchers).  The report stays as a diagnostic for the routing chain.

 * of wall clock and the questions here come in pairs that only mean something
 * together: "did the list dispatcher run" is worth little without "how many
 * messages did the database task dequeue", measured on the *same* run and the
 * same request stream.  Splitting them across two runs compares two different
 * streams -- the number of type-1 requests MAIN examines varies by a factor of
 * several between runs -- and that is exactly how a real difference gets read
 * as noise.  Unlike a breakpoint, a watch never stops the guest, so adding a
 * second one costs nothing that matters.

 * resolution is 15.6 ms and which Windows 11 additionally coarsens for
 * processes without a foreground window.  A tick that fires late enough to
 * overlap the next one is coalesced by the level-sensitive TMU line, and the
 * guest loses it: measured 720 ticks a second of the 1000 programmed.  Ask
 * for a 0.5 ms resolution and opt out of the background throttling.  Both
 * calls are looked up at run time so the build needs no extra library.
