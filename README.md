# cdj2000-emulator

An emulator for the Pioneer CDJ-2000 that runs the player's own firmware.

The CDJ-2000 has two processors, and this emulates both. The SH-4 that runs
the player boots on a QEMU machine written for it; the Blackfin BF531 that
paints the display boots on GNU's Blackfin simulator, patched; the two talk
over the same serial link they use on the real board. Every pixel is drawn by
Pioneer's code, and every button press travels the path a real press travels.

**It is a developer tool for firmware modding and reverse engineering**, a
place to run a change and watch what the machine does with it without risking
a player. It is not a way to use a CDJ-2000 on a desktop.

## What works

* Both boards boot their stock firmware (MAIN 4.33, GUI 4.20 or the NXS 1.44
  image), complete their handshake and reach the player screen in about 30 s
  of wall clock. MAIN's RTOS tick runs at its real 1000 Hz.
* The panel is drawn at 480x234 from the display DMA, and all 48 inputs the
  board decodes -- 40 buttons and 8 analogue fields, rotary encoder included --
  are driven from the host through the real panel path. MAIN's own service-mode
  name table says which bit is which key (`INPUT_MANIFEST.md`).
* The disc drive, the audio DSP and the USB device report up, so no caution
  banner stands in the way; MAIN's service monitor and caution store are
  readable over the emulated debug port.
* In the legacy CDJ-2000 workflow, an SD card image with a rekordbox export is the library: categories,
  playlists and track lists on screen, a track loaded with its overview
  waveform, detail waveform, beat grid, cue markers, duration, BPM and key,
  and a time display that runs from PLAY (`tools/cdj_main/twoboard.py` runs
  that recipe into a fresh run directory).
* The legacy DSP model answers the load handshake, keeps the position report,
  locates, loops on the beat, and raises events on its interrupt line.
* The NXS workflow boots stock firmware, browses an SD WAV fixture using native
  panel controls, loads its track name and duration, and advances the native
  playhead with `--functional-dsp-audio`. This proves the firmware playback
  path; the emulator still does not provide audible output.
* A USB stick is a disk image on the SoC's USB host module. With the two
  update keys held at power-on, MAIN's updater takes a `C2KMAIN.UPD` from it
  and rewrites the flash model; the boot ROM's recovery path (the loader at
  flash 0x10000, run when the application checksum fails) does the same; and
  with the GUI board on the link a `C2KGUI.UPD` is streamed to it, checked,
  erased and programmed into the simulator's flash, dumped afterwards for
  comparison. `tools/cdj_main/make_upd.py` builds a MAIN update file from any
  flash image. See "A firmware update" in RUNNING.md.

## What does not

* **No audio.** The DSP is a TI Aureus DA710 with a TMS320C674x core (see
  `RUNNING.md`), and `emulator/qemu/cdj_c674x.c` executes its instruction set
  from TI's published SPRUFE8B - partially: see `DSP_ARCHITECTURE_COVERAGE.md`
  for what is and is not implemented. Instruction coverage is incomplete;
  accepting a mnemonic does not establish support for all its encodings or
  correct execution. See the [current probe scope](analysis/agent-dev-dsp-coverage.md).
  Native NXS playback also depends on DSP device and timing behavior.
* **No jog**, no pitch. The position report runs at nominal speed.
* In the legacy scripted workflow, the detail waveform and beat grid reach the GUI through the link proxy
  (`tools/cdj_main/link_inject.py`), which also injects the browse and load
  requests. The NXS native browser can select and load with the encoder's
  ENTER contact; short clicks and long holds have different meanings.
* Switching sources after boot is unreliable (six of eight); the card given at
  launch is reliable. The USB stick as a music source has not been tried.
* The GUI simulator is about thirty times slower than the chip on real work,
  and the live link has intermittent stalls and, rarely, a double fault. Run
  it again; the fault line is in the simulator's log.
* No link between players.

## Firmware is not included

**This repository contains no Pioneer firmware and never will.** You supply
your own copy of the firmware update, which the manufacturer distributes free
to owners, and the extractors turn it into the images the emulators load. See
[FIRMWARE.md](FIRMWARE.md). Nothing here is derived from Pioneer's code: no
images, no disassembly, no screenshots.

## Getting started

### NXS research branch: interactive deck

For firmware development, start a deck with a generated test track and local
debugging in one command:

```sh
python -m tools.cdj_main.nxs_vm --test-track --debug --lightweight --ui \
  --seconds 1800 --functional-dsp-audio --source-key-when-ready
```

This creates a timestamped run under `runs/`, prints follow-up commands, and
records the firmware and emulator hashes. The deck shows run progress below
the LCD; **Diagnostics** provides session state, browser replies, frame age,
recent actions, fault lines, and debugger endpoints. Fresh-only link delivery
is the NXS default because cached repeats saturated the GUI receive queue in
connected runs. Use `--cached-link` only to compare the old transport behavior.
The source key waits for the SD browser table instead of a guessed timestamp.

Agents can control the same run without locating ports:

```sh
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run status --json
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run press enter
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run wait-playback --timeout 120
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run switch rev off
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run qmp registers
python -m tools.cdj_main.dev runs/my-run stop
```

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for track selection, memory inspection,
screenshots, firmware overrides, and reproducible agent handoffs.

For the NXS firmware already prepared under `firmware/nxs/`, use the dedicated
launcher from this repository directory:

```sh
python -m tools.cdj_main.nxs_vm runs/nxs-interactive --seconds 3600 --ui
```

Choose a new run-directory name each time. `--ui` opens the current interactive
deck and connects its buttons to that run's panel port; without it the run is
headless. Close the deck to stop both emulators. Restart an older viewer to pick
up Python changes, and rebuild `bin/cdj-run` after simulator patch changes.

Ordinary hardware buttons support mouse-down/up and Enter/Space holds, including
release outside the button or on focus loss. MENU holds now open the real
firmware's UTILITY screen after the SIC mask-order fix (`69d0d88`). The separate
E-7206 auth-chip error remains. Native NXS SD loading of `TESTTONE.WAV` was
reproduced with stock firmware on 2026-09-15, including the ten-second duration
on the display. USB track loading and audible playback remain unverified.
The legacy functionality described above is not an NXS completion claim.
See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md), [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) and
[NXS_GUI_STALL.md](NXS_GUI_STALL.md) for current evidence and limitations.

The NXS launcher also accepts experimental `--sd IMAGE` and `--usb IMAGE`
mounts. Generate a plain WAV/FAT32 fixture with
`python -m tools.cdj_main.test_media runs/test-media`, then supply
`runs/test-media/test-track.img`. Each image uses a disposable QEMU overlay;
guest writes are discarded when the run closes. Image attachment alone does not
establish firmware track loading or audible playback.
Add `--trace-media` to record SD-controller and USB-host register activity in
`main-stderr.log`. This diagnostic adds host overhead and can change timing;
it does not enable the legacy fake media-state RAM write.
For insertion diagnostics, `--sd-insert-seconds 110` schedules the existing
card-presence transition 110 virtual seconds after reset; `0` keeps the slot
empty. This requires `--sd` or `--test-track`. The default remains the controller's 20 seconds.
Virtual seconds are not a promise about wall-clock boot time.

The media manager can take longer than the first source press. Add
`--source-key-retries 5` to retry the named source automatically (the default
interval is 120 virtual seconds), or set `--source-key-at` explicitly when a
firmware change has a known readiness point.

To quickly inspect what a run achieved, use the read-only run report:

```sh
python -m tools.cdj_main.run_report runs/my-run
python -m tools.cdj_main.run_report runs/my-run --json
```

It summarizes visible media entries, native load responses, framebuffer
observations, common emulator fault lines, and the raw artifact files. The
report keeps audio playback separate from track-load evidence.

While a run is still active, `python -m tools.cdj_main.run_state runs/my-run`
prints the latest browser reply and frame status. Add `--json` for an agent
to consume the bounded snapshot, including the current session endpoints and
recent diagnostic lines.

### Original CDJ-2000 setup

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh                                   # the GUI board
git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git /c/qemu-src
sh scripts/build-qemu-sh4.sh /c/qemu-src                       # the MAIN board
# put C2KGUI.UPD and C2KMAIN.UPD in firmware/, then:
python -m tools.cdj_gui.extract     firmware/C2KGUI.UPD  firmware
python -m tools.cdj_gui.main_unpack firmware/C2KMAIN.UPD firmware
python -m tools.cdj_main.view_vm
```

[BUILD.md](BUILD.md) has the platform notes. [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) has
everything you can do once it boots: the environment knobs, the two-board
recipe, the speed numbers, the update procedure, and the measurements behind
each claim above.

## One rule about the UI

Only the inner rectangle is the 480x234 panel. `BROWSE` / `TAG LIST` / `INFO`
/ `MENU` and `LINK` / `USB` / `SD` / `DISC` are hardware buttons, backlit
plastic that appears in no frame the firmware draws. Virtual buttons belong
beside the panel image, never in it; `tests/test_panel_layout.py` enforces
that the captured frame is shown untouched.

## Layout

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `emulator/qemu/` | the SH-4 MAIN board: machine, panel, link, SD, ATAPI, USB host, DSP |
| `emulator/*.hw` | GNU sim board descriptions for the Blackfin side |
| `patches/` | what has to change in QEMU and in GDB's simulator, and why |
| `tools/cdj_main/` | launchers, panel control, the two-board recipe, card and update images |
| `tools/cdj_gui/` | the viewer, the firmware extractors, link decoders, stimulus generators |
| `tests/` | the host-side test suite; most of it needs no emulator |
| `INPUT_MANIFEST.md` | all 48 inputs, what was done with each, what was measured |

`patches/README.md` is worth reading on its own: four omissions in QEMU's SH-4
interrupt handling that are invisible to Linux and fatal to a uITRON RTOS, a
Blackfin packed-ALU instruction that committed a cycle early, and the AMD
command set the CDJ's flash actually speaks.
