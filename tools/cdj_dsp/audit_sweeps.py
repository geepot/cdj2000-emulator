"""Reproducible C674x audit sweeps: compact space, control registers, rollback.

These three measurements were first made with throwaway scratch programs, whose
numbers no one could regenerate once the session ended.  An audit number that
cannot be reproduced is not evidence, so the sweeps live in
``tests/cstub/c674x-isa-probe.c`` and this module drives them and records the
result with the hashes of everything that produced it.

    python -m tools.cdj_dsp.audit_sweeps analysis/dsp/audit_sweeps.json

What each sweep does and does not establish:

* ``compact`` - all 65,536 16-bit words under 13 named compact-header
  configurations and 3 named register profiles.  A word counts as accepted if any
  configuration accepts it, and the record names which.  This is DECODE
  ACCEPTANCE, not semantics.  The defensible coverage figure is the count of
  words rejected as "compact instruction not implemented": it is a property of
  the decoder alone, unlike the accepted total, which moves with the probe's
  memory window and register values.
* ``control`` - drives a real ``MVC`` in both directions for all 32 control
  register ids, using encodings taken from TI's assembler.  The recorded mask is
  what reads back after writing all ones, so it is directly comparable to the
  reserved-bit columns of the SPRUFE8B per-register field tables.
* ``atomicity`` - a rejected execute packet must leave CPU state and memory
  bit-identical.  Failures here would mean a partially applied packet.

#
#   Figure C-19 Dx5p (printed page 730) draws bit 0 as a literal "1" with "s=1"
#   written underneath - contrast Figure C-18 Dx5 on the same page, whose bit 0
#   is an unconstrained "s" - and notes "src2 = dst = B15".  The ADDAW
#   description (printed page 123) says the s bit picks both unit and register
#   file: "s = 1 indicates the unit is D2 and dst is in the B register file", so
#   a B15 destination forces s = 1, and Dx5p has no x bit to cross with.
#   cl6x -mv6740 refuses "ADDAW .D1 B15,4,B15" with E0800 "Functional unit
#   specifier disagrees with operation" and "SUBAW .D1 B15,4,B15" with E0800
#   "Functional unit side requested does not match side needed"; both assemble
#   on .D2.  GNU prints "addaw .D1X b15,0,b15", a cross-path WRITE no C674x
#   unit can perform.
#
#   Figure F-31 Sx1 op 110 (printed page 756) spells the restriction out in the

#   "MVC .S1 B0,ILC" with W0005 "Operation requires .S2 unit".
#
# Refusing these is correct behaviour, so they belong with the undefined
