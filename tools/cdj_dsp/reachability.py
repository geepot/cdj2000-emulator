"""Does the captured firmware contain the instructions this core cannot execute?

Two questions are answered separately and never merged:

1. **executed** - the replay-confirmed instruction addresses of a semantic
   inventory (``runs/dsp-semantic-inventory-3.json``), plus every
   ``instruction not implemented`` fault recorded in ``runs/*/coverage.json``.
   Strong evidence: the emulator fetched the packet and decoded this word in it.
   Note that a confirmed address is a *source fetch* of its packet, not a
   predicate-body execution, and that the confirmed set is biased: a packet is
   only confirmed if it completed, so an unimplemented instruction can appear in
   this evidence class **only** as a recorded fault.
2. **present** - a fetch-packet-aligned position in a captured memory image whose
   disassembly names the instruction.  Weak evidence: 256 KB of L2 holds tables,
   sample buffers and strings, and a pattern match is not code.

False-positive controls applied to (2), all reported in the output:

* positions come from the same GNU ``tic6x`` disassembler the semantic inventory
  uses, driven over whole 32-byte fetch packets, so compact headers and 16-bit
  units follow the p-bit/header structure instead of a sweep at every offset;
* a fetch packet contributes nothing unless *every* word in it decodes - real
  code contains no undefined words;
* identical fetch packets are deduplicated across inputs, so a hit is counted
  once and carries the number of input images it appears in;
* each hit is labelled by whether its fetch packet is one the replay evidence
  demonstrably executed, is within ``--neighbourhood`` bytes of one, or neither;
* the same pipeline runs over two control blobs of the same total size - the
  firmware's own bytes shuffled, and uniform pseudo-random bytes - and those
  per-mnemonic hit counts are the reported noise floor.

Nothing here promotes a candidate to confirmed code.  ``verdict`` is
``reached-confirmed`` only on evidence class (1).
