"""Dense frames of a chosen stretch of a run, thinned as they arrive.

boot_vm --frames samples the live frame on a wall-clock tick (2 s by default), which is far too coarse
for an animation, and the simulator can only publish every frame it draws (patch 15,
BFIN_GUI_ARCHIVE_DIR): a few hundred megabytes of PPM for a minute of a running GUI.  This keeps what a
GIF needs and nothing else:

    boot_vm ... --dense-frames DIR --dense-window 40:70 --dense-fps 10 --dense-gif run.gif

While the guest clock is inside the window (less a second of margin) the simulator is armed.  Every frame
it archives is stamped with guest seconds; the first one at or after each 1/FPS step is kept as a PNG named
by that stamp, the rest are deleted the moment they appear.  At the end the kept frames are written as a GIF
whose delays follow the stamps (a frame stays until the next one is due), so what the GIF shows runs at
guest speed however long the emulator took.
