# Build the CDJ-2000 GUI board simulator: GNU sim from GDB 17.2, plus the
# patches in patches/.
#
#   sh scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh [options] [GDB_TARBALL_OR_DIR]
#
# With no argument the script looks for gdb-17.2.tar.xz beside the repository
# and in build/, and downloads it if neither is there.  The result is installed
# as bin/cdj-run.
#
# Options:
#   --march=ARCH     -march for the simulator; default "native", because the
#                    binary is a local tool.  Pass --march=nocona (the MSYS2
#                    baseline) for a binary that has to run elsewhere.
#   --opt=FLAG       optimisation level, default -O3.
#   --profile        build with -pg into a separate object tree and install
#                    as bin/cdj-run-pg, for gprof.  Give the run
#                    BFIN_EXIT_AFTER_WALL=<seconds> so the simulator exits
#                    normally and gmon.out is written.
#   --reconfigure    throw the object tree away first.  configure runs only
#                    when there is no config.status, so a change of flags
#                    does nothing without this.
#
# CDJ_SIM_CFLAGS overrides the compiler flags outright (it replaces the
# -O/-march/-g set, and --profile still appends -pg).
#
# Prerequisites: a C toolchain, make, patch, tar.  On MSYS2 MINGW64:
#   pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
#
# Everything upstream is GPLv3; see THIRD_PARTY.md.
