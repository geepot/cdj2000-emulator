"""What the runtime control channel actually does to the panel payload.

`emulator/qemu/cdj2000_input.c` is compiled here against the stub headers in
`tests/cstub/`, given a real loopback socket and a real client, and stepped one
panel exchange at a time with a virtual clock the harness controls.  So these
are measurements of the shipped code, not of a Python restatement of it -- and
they cost no run slot, which is the scarce thing in this project.

What they cannot show is that MAIN reacts.  That needs the machine.  What they
do show is that the frame carries what it
is meant to carry, so that when the run happens, a negative result means the
firmware and not the plumbing.
